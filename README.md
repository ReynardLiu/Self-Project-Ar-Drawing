# ✨ AR Hand-Tracking Drawing (Python)

An interactive **Augmented Reality Drawing Application** built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.  
This project allows you to **draw in the air using your hand**, without touching the screen, mouse, or pen.

The system tracks your **hand landmarks** in real-time through your webcam.  
Your **index finger** acts as a **virtual brush**, and specific **hand gestures** let you **erase** or **clear** the canvas.
